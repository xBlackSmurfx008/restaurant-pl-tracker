### 4. 🥕 Ingredient Locker

Your ingredient inventory with automatic unit conversion.

**The Problem Solved:**
> You buy a "50lb bag of flour" but your recipe uses "2 cups"

**Our Solution:**
The app converts units automatically. Enter how you buy it and how you use it — we calculate the cost per usage unit.

**Example:**
```
Buy: 50lb bag of flour for $25.00
Use: cups in recipes
Conversion: 50 lbs = 200 cups
Cost per cup: $0.125 (calculated automatically)
```

## 📊 Understanding Your Numbers

### The Math We Do For You

**Cost Per Unit:**
```
Your Price ÷ (Units per Package × Yield %) = Cost Per Unit

Example: $25 bag ÷ (200 cups × 95%) = $0.13 per cup
```

**Plate Cost:**
```
Sum of (Each Ingredient Qty × Its Cost Per Unit) + Q-Factor

Example: Burger = Bun($0.35) + Patty($2.10) + Toppings($0.85) + Q($0.50) = $3.80
```

**Food Cost Percentage:**
```
Plate Cost ÷ Selling Price × 100

Example: $3.80 ÷ $12.99 × 100 = 29.3% ✅
```

**Profit:**
```
Selling Price - Plate Cost = Gross Profit

Example: $12.99 - $3.80 = $9.19 per burger
```
